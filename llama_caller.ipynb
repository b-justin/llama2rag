      "\"Happy birthday to the most awesome Andrew in the world! May your day be as epic as your beard and your love for [insert hobby or interest here] üòÇ\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Andrew, you're more than just a friend to me. You're a constant source of support, laughter, and inspiration. I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings for you. Happy birthday, my dear friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n",
